# Prework study guide project

## Description

This project is the first iteration of a webpage by Andrew Gibbs. It was meant to teach me aspects of Github, Git, HTML, Javascript and CSS as I developed it under the guidance of the Instructors at the UCF bootcamp. It is my goal to build a working foundation of knowledge and familiarity with these subjects.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage


Once the prework study guide is open you can view the available topics by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) to open the Chrome DevTools. From the new window click on the tab labeled "Console". You should now see a list of topics available as well as a randomly generated suggestion as to which topic to start with.
